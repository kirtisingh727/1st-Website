<h1>About us:<br> The Grand Radha Palace </h1>
<p> The Grand Radha Palace is a heritage, five-star, luxury hotel in the Colaba area of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India situated next to the Gateway of India.<br>
Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, it opened in 1903 as The Grand Radha Palace and has historically often been known simply as "The Radha". <br>
The hotel is named after the Radha Palace which is located in the city of Mathura approximately 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) from Mumbai.<br>
It has been considered one of the finest hotels in the East since the time of the British Raj.<br>

Part of the Grand Radha Palace Resorts and Palaces, the hotel has 560 or 600 rooms and 44 suites and is considered the flagship property of the group;<br>
 it employs 1,600 staff. The hotel is made up of two different structures: the Taj Mahal Palace and the Tower, which are historically and architecturally<br>
distinct from each other (the Taj Mahal Palace was built in 1903; the Tower was opened in 1972).<br><br>

The hotel has received many notable guests, from presidents to captains of industry and movie stars.
